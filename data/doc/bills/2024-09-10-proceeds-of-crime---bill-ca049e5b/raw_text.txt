Seizure  of
suspected
proceeds  of

(2) Where a Notice calling for explanation has been served
on any person under section 68 in respect of any property,
such property shall not be seized, unless –

10

(a) such person has not provided within the time frame

stipulated  a  truthful  explanation;

(b) the  explanation  provided  is  found  to  be  false,

inaccurate, insufficient or misleading; or

(c) it  transpires  that  the  property  in  issue  had  been
received by gift, procured or derived in a fraudulent
manner.

(3) Upon seizure of a suspected proceeds of crime or a
property of the corresponding value of the proceeds of crime,
the  Investigation  Officer  shall  take  possession,  control,
custody  or  dominion  of  such  property,  by  serving  on  the
person who is in possession, control, custody or dominion
of such property a Notice of Seizure in the form specified in

control  or  dominion  of  such  property  presents  credible
material to the Investigation Officer to satisfy him that the
property in issue had been inherited by him a minimum of
thirty years prior to such date on which the Notice calling

15

for explanation has been served, no further action shall be
taken by the Investigation Officer under this Act:

Provided  further,  notwithstanding  anything  to  the
contrary  in  the  above  proviso,  if  there  exists  prima  facie
material  that  the  property  in  issue  had  been  originally
procured by the committing of an unlawful activity that had
an adverse impact on public finance or public property as
defined  in  the  Offences  Against  the  Public  Property  Act,
notwithstanding the lapse of thirty years from the point of
inheritance  of  such  property,  it  shall  be  lawful  for  an
Investigation Officer to seize such property.

(4)  If  based  on  the  material  available  there  exists
reasonable grounds for the Investigation Officer to believe
that a property is proceeds of crime or is a property to the
corresponding  value  of  proceeds  of  crime  and  that  unless
immediate  steps  are  taken  to  seize  such  property  the
objectives of this Act would be defeated, he shall be entitled
after  obtaining  the  approval  of  the  Designated  Officer,  to
take  steps  to  temporarily  seize  the  property  at  the  time  a
Notice calling for explanation under section 68 is served:

Provided however, if any suspected proceeds of crime or
a property to the corresponding value of proceeds of crime
is  temporarily  seized  at  the  time  a  Notice  calling  for
explanation is served, such seizure shall remain valid only
till  the  explanatory  statement  to  the  Notice  calling  for
explanation  is  received  by  the  Investigation  Officer,  and
until he has had reasonable time to consider the explanation
provided in the explanatory statement and either accept or
reject such explanation, and take a decision thereon.

possession  of  the  property  to  the  party  from  whom  its
possession was obtained. If the Investigation Officer decides
to  reject  the  explanation  provided  in  the  explanatory
statement,  he  shall  be  entitled  to  make  a  further  order  in
terms  of  this  Act  to  seize  the  property  and  thereby  retain
possession of the property.

 (6) Unless as provided in subsection (2), a property shall
not  be  seized  unless  an  opportunity  had  been  provided  to
the person who claims ownership, possession, or has custody,
control or dominion of such property to explain that such
property  is  not  proceeds  of  crime,  and  the  explanation
provided in the explanatory statement had been rejected by
the Investigation Officer for reasons to be recorded therefor:

5

10

Provided however, if in the circumstances–

15

(a) providing  an  opportunity  as  aforesaid  was  not

practicable; or

(b) any  delay  in  affording  such  opportunity  or  time
that  may  be  taken  for  the  verification  of  the
information contained in the explanatory statement
would defeat the objectives of this Act; and

20

(c) there exist reasonable grounds for the Investigation
Officer to believe that the property is proceeds of
crime or is a property of the corresponding value of
such proceeds of crime,

25

he shall forthwith with the approval of the Designated Officer
seize such property.

(7)  Following  an  order  for  the  restraint  or  the  seizure
thereof, the property suspected to be proceeds of crime or is
property  of  the  corresponding  value  of  such  proceeds  of

such property and documents, records, or information relating
to  such  property,  for  the  purpose  of  determining  whether
either the entirety or any part of such property or any other
property within or connected with the restrained or seized
property shall be excluded from seizure or a judicial freezing
order as the case may be.

(8)  When  serving  the  Notice  of  Seizure,  the  relevant
Investigation Officer shall forthwith take possession of the
relevant  property:

25

Provided however, even if  an Investigation Officer shall
seize  any  of  the  following  items  of  property,  he  shall  not
take  possession  and  control  of  such  property  unless  there
are reasons to conclude that the possessor or any other party
on his behest is acting in a manner to prevent the realization
of or defeat the objectives of this Act -

(a) actual sole residence of the person in possession in

such  property;

(b) essential wearing apparels and jewellery;

(c) essential  furniture,  fixtures  and  fittings,  and

cooking utensils at such residence;

(d) a  vehicle  used  for  the  daily  transportation  of  the

property  referred  to  in  subsection  (8)  and  permits  its
possession to remain with the person who possessed it, he
shall require such person to enter into a bond requiring such
person to submit the property to the High Court in the event
of the High Court making an order for judicial freezing of
such property.

(10)  Pending  an  order  from  the  High  Court  for  the
protection,  preservation  and  management  of  the  seized
property,  it  shall  be  the  duty  of  the  relevant  Investigation
Officer to provide necessary protection and take necessary
measures for the protection and preservation of the seized
property. For such purpose, an Investigation Officer shall be
entitled to obtain the services of any state agency.

(11)  Within  seventy  two  hours  of  the  seizure  of  any
suspected  proceeds  of  crime  or  a  property  of  the
corresponding value of such proceed of crime, the relevant
Investigation  Officer  shall,  report  such  seizure  to  the
Magistrate’s Court within whose jurisdiction the seizure took
place. The purpose of such notification shall be to apprise
the Magistrate of the action taken in terms of this Act and to

90

enable the Investigation Officer to obtain orders to facilitate
the conduct of further investigations.

(12) The afore-stated seizure of the suspected proceeds of
crime  or  a  property  of  the  corresponding  value  of  such
proceeds  of  crime,  shall  be  in  force  for  a  period  of  up  to
thirty days, and unless earlier vacated by the Investigation
Officer, shall lapse unless within such period a judge of the
High Court issues an order for judicial freezing under and in
terms of this Act or refuses to issue a judicial freezing order.

(13) Where upon the examination of the property or any
material, and the representations that may have been made
to  him,  an  Investigation  Officer  forms  the  view  that  the
Restraining Order issued or the Seizure carried out shall be
varied  or  vacated,  he  shall  with  the  approval  of  the
Designated  Officer  make  such  variation  or  vacation,  and
where necessary serve such revised restraining order or Notice
of seizure to the party who previously possessed, controlled,
had custody, or held dominion over such property and, where
necessary release the relevant property. He shall forthwith
file a report in the relevant Magistrate’s Court informing the
action taken in that regard.

(14) Where, given the attendant circumstances, obtaining
the  prior  approval  of  the  Designated  Officer  may  not  be
practicable  or  may  defeat  the  objectives  of  this  Act,  an
Investigation Officer may for reasons to be recorded, on his
own  motion  serve  such  restraining  order  or  carry  out  the
Seizure of such proceed of crime as the case may be, and
thereafter  as  soon  as  possible  obtain  the  approval  of  the
Designated Officer.

necessitate  action  being  taken  in  the  High  Court  for  the
judicial freezing and subsequent forfeiture of such property,
submit a request to the Attorney-General to consider taking
action in terms of this Act to institute and prosecute legal
action  in  the  High  Court  for  the  judicial  freezing  and
forfeiture of property.

(3) If following the consideration of the available material
the Designated Officer forms the view that the property in
issue is not proceeds of crime, he shall if such property has
not been frozen, make an application through the relevant
Investigation  Officer  to  the  relevant  Magistrate’s  Court
notifying  the  Magistrate  of  the  decision  taken  not  to  take
any further action with regard to the property in issue:

Provided however, prior to taking an action as stipulated
above, the Designated Officer shall be entitled to seek and
obtain the advice of the Attorney-General.

25

(4) If following a consideration of material collected in
the course of the investigation the Designated Officer on his
own motion or having obtained the advice of the Attorney-
General forms the opinion that a property in respect of which
a restraint order has been issued or a seizure made shall be
released as no sufficient grounds exist that such property is
proceeds  of  crime  or  the  property  is  of  the  corresponding
value of such proceed of crime, he shall for reasons to be

General  of  the  Commission  to  Investigate  Allegations  of
Bribery  or  Corruption,  Attorney-General  shall  act  on  the
instructions of the Commission.

(7) If an Investigation Officer, upon the conduct of further
investigations, forms the opinion that the released property
is proceeds of crime, he may within one year of the previous
release  of  the  property,  with  the  prior  approval  of  the
Designated Officer make an application to the High Court
having served prior notice to the party who may be affected
by a fresh restraining and seizure, seek from the High Court
an  order  for  the  restraining  and  seizing  of  the  previously
released property.

High Court following inquiry, or ex-parte if it is satisfied
that the Notice to the affected party has been duly served.

(6) If an Investigation Officer is of the view that a period
of time in excess of seven working days is necessary to carry
out  further  investigations  for  the  purpose  of  making  an
application for an order from the High Court to freeze the
seized property, he shall with the approval of the Designated
Officer, within seven working days from the seizure of the
property  make  an  application  setting  out  the  reasons  for
such application to the High Court seeking an extension of
time which shall not extend beyond another seven working
days from the expiry of the afore-stated seven working days
to make an application to freeze the seized property.

(7)  If  such  an  application  is  made  by  an  Investigation

grounds that the released property is proceeds of crime, he
may  within  one  year  of  such  order  for  the  release  of  the
property, and with the approval of the Designated Officer
make one further application to the High Court having served
Notice  to  the  party  to  whom  the  property  was  previously

affected  party  has  been  duly  served  and  there  exists
reasonable grounds to believe that such property in question
is proceeds of crime.

(12) (a) Upon an application by an Investigation Officer
to the High Court for the judicial freezing of a property that
is believed to be proceeds of crime, and the High Court is
satisfied that there exist reasonable grounds to believe that
the property is proceeds of crime and therefore it shall be
frozen,  the  court  may  on  an  application  by  a  party  from

Provided  however  such  temporary  release  shall  be
subject to such party submitting to court reasonable security
in the form and nature as specified by court and subject to
conditions  that  may  be  imposed  by  court  including
conditions restraining specified transactions.

(13) Such order for temporary release of property shall be
made only if the High Court is satisfied that the temporary
release of the property shall not defeat the objectives of this
Act, and the court is satisfied that the property shall remain
available without the diminishing of its value due to wilful
conduct of any party, to be subject to forfeiture proceeding
under this Act.

case may be, for reasons to be recorded by the High Court.

(17) If following the judicial freezing of a property by the
High  Court,  and  if  proceedings  are  instituted  in  the  High
Court or the Magistrate’s Court as the case may be for the
committing of the unlawful activity which is alleged to have
yielded the frozen property, the judicial freezing order made
by  the  High  Court  shall  remain  in  force  for  a  period  not
exceeding  three  months  following  the  completion  of  such
trial.

(18) Where the accused is convicted under the proceedings
referred to in subsection (17) and an appeal is filed in respect

order  and  such  extended  period  during  which  forfeiture
proceedings shall be conducted. Such order for the judicial
freezing,  protection,  preservation  and  management  of  the
property shall be made as provided in Part IV of this Act.

(21) Following a High Court judicial freezing of suspected
proceeds of crime, the court may, pending the conduct of
forfeiture proceedings or the making of a forfeiture order, on
application  by  a  party  entitled  to  such  property,  after
obtaining  a  valuation  of  the  property,  temporarily  release
such property or part thereof to the claimant, if the court is
satisfied that the claimant is –

(a) acting in good faith and is entitled to such property

if found to be proceeds of crime;

(b) willing  to  submit  security  to  the  value  of  such

freezing of property in terms of any law which authorizes
the judicial freezing of property:

Officer does not make an application for the appointment of
the  PCMA  or  a  Receiver  or  a  Special  Manager,  and
nevertheless the Court upon the consideration of the nature,
value and attendant circumstances pertaining to the property
that  has  been  seized  or  frozen  is  of  the  view  that  the
appointment of the PCMA or a Receiver or a Special Manager
is  necessary,  the  Court  shall  at  its  discretion  confer  the
responsibility  of  protecting,  preserving  and  managing  the
property to the PCMA or make an appointment of a Receiver
or a Special Manager in terms of this Part of this Act.

(2)  Ordinarily  an  order  authorizing  the  PCMA  or  the
appointment  of  a  Receiver  or  a  Special  Manager  shall  be
made after an order judicially freezing the suspected proceed

however, the High Court may make order authorizing the
PCMA or appoint a Receiver or a Special Manager to protect,
preserve and manage the property, pending an order being
made  regarding  the  judicial  freezing  of  the  suspected
proceeds of crime, provided such property has been restrained
or seized, and proceedings have been instituted in the High
Court for the judicial freezing of the suspected proceeds of
crime.

(3) If after inquiry, should the court be satisfied that the
Attorney-General has made out a prima facie case, the Court
shall call upon the Respondents to show cause as to why the
Attorney-General’s application should not be allowed and
hence as to why the property should not be forfeited.

General  has  made  out  a  prima  facie  case,  the  Court  shall
dismiss the application without calling on the respondents
to show cause, and make order vacating the judicial freezing

(14) If during proceedings under this Part of the Act, on
evidence  placed  before  Court  and  further  evidence  if  any
called for and examined by court, the court becomes satisfied
that the property in respect of which forfeiture proceedings
has  been  instituted  comprises  partly  of  proceeds  of  crime
and partly of property which does not constitute proceeds of
crime,  the  court  shall  obtain  a  valuation  of  such  property
and determine the percentage value of such property which

be  paid  called  ‘substituted  money
forfeiture’ ; or

(ii) for an order for the forfeiture of a property
of  the  convicted  accused  which  is  of
comparable  monetary  value  called
‘substituted property forfeiture’.

(2) (a)When determining the value of the property to be
subjected to an order of ‘substituted property forfeiture’ and
the  monetary  value  of  the  ‘substituted  money  forfeiture’,
the  Court  may  take  into  account  the  appreciation  or  the
fluctuation  of  the  value  of  the  original  proceeds  of  crime
due to the passage of time and the potential of such proceeds
of crime being used for investment or business purposes.

(b)  For  such  purpose,  the  Attorney-General  shall  be

(4)  If  it  is  not  possible  to  identify  a  property  of  the
convicted  accused  which  is  of  comparable  value  to  the
proceeds  of  crime,  the  Court  may  on  application  by  the
Attorney-General  direct  the  convicted  accused  to  make  a
sworn declaration of his properties. Following the submission

and consideration of such declaration, the Attorney-General
may make an application in terms of the above-mentioned
procedure  for  forfeiture  of  any  property  of  the  convicted
accused  of  comparable  value  based  on  the  information
contained in the said declaration.

(5)  If  the  afore-stated  declaration  does  not  contain
information pertaining to any property of comparable value,
the Court may on application by the Attorney-General make
an order on the convicted accused to pay a sum of money
equivalent to the value of proceeds of crime.

(6) The afore-stated sum of money ordered by the Court
shall be recovered in the same manner as a fine imposed by
Court.

(7) In proceedings under this Part of the Act for forfeiture
of value - based proceeds of crime, if any party objects to the
value or other property derived out of the committing of an
unlawful activity being forfeited, the Court shall direct such
claimant to initially submit to court security in the manner
the court may require to be deposited.

(8)  If  the  trial  Court  following  the  conviction  of  the
accused, when imposing the sentence, had imposed on the
convicted accused a penalty under the applicable law to an
amount not less than the value of the relevant proceeds of
crime, the Attorney-General shall not be entitled to institute
proceedings under this Act for value-based forfeiture of the
proceeds of crime.

125. (1) Where a property  suspected  to  be  proceeds  of
crime has been investigated into and material collected to

suspected to be proceeds of crime as provided in this Act.
Such civil judicial proceedings shall be referred to as non-

(2) For the forfeiture of a proceed of crime in terms of non

necessary to prosecute and obtain a conviction against the
person  who  had  committed  the  unlawful  activity  which
yielded the relevant proceeds of crime.

(3) Forfeiture proceedings under non - conviction based
forfeiture  proceedings  shall  not  be  an  alternative  to  the
prosecution  of  a  person  for  having  committed  the
corresponding unlawful activity. Where investigations yield
sufficient  evidence,  the  person  who  committed  the
corresponding unlawful activity shall be prosecuted in terms
of the applicable law.

(4) Where a person has been prosecuted and convicted of
having committed an unlawful activity, and the proceeds of
such unlawful activity are available, the post – conviction
forfeiture of proceeds of crime shall be ordinarily enforced
for the forfeiture of the proceeds of such unlawful activity:

Provided  however,  parallel  to  or  in  the  absence  of  the
Attorney-General  instituting  criminal  proceedings  and
prosecuting the offender responsible for having committed
the unlawful activity, it shall be lawful for proceedings to be
instituted and carried out in terms of this Act in respect of
the  proceeds  of  such  unlawful  activity,  provided  the
requirements contained in this Act relating to non-conviction
based forfeiture of proceeds of crime have been satisfied. It
may  be  possible  to  have  proceedings  for  non-conviction
based  forfeiture  taking  place  parallelly  to  or  in  the
alternative to a criminal prosecution.

(5) The High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka holden
in  the  judicial  zone  of  Colombo  shall  have  jurisdiction  to
entertain  and  adjudicate  upon  an  application  for  non-
conviction  based  forfeiture  of  proceed  of  crime
notwithstanding the location of such property being outside
the territorial jurisdiction of such court:

Provided  however,  where  the  Chief  Justice  on  an
application  by  the  Attorney-General  directs  that  an
application for non-conviction based forfeiture of proceeds
of  crime  shall  be  entertained  and  adjudicated  by  a  High
Court of any other judicial zone, such High Court shall have
jurisdiction:

Provided further when determining an application by the
Attorney-General  for  a  direction  the  Chief  Justice  shall
consider  whether  due  to  delays  in  the  conduct  and
completion  of  hearing  for  non-conviction  based  forfeiture
proceedings would defeat the objectives of this Act, it would
be  desirable  jurisdiction  to  be  vested  in  a  High  Court  not
holden in the judicial zone of Colombo.

(6) While  ordinarily,  for  the  institution  of  non-
conviction based forfeiture proceedings, a judicial freezing
order  shall  be  a  prerequisite,  if  the  Attorney-General  can
establish that for reasons beyond the control of the relevant
Designated Officer or Investigation Officer, it was not possible
to  obtain  a  judicial  freezing  order,  he  shall  be  entitled  to
institute  proceedings  for  non-conviction  based  forfeiture
even in the absence of a judicial freezing order.

For the successful forfeiture of proceed of crime,
the High Court shall on a balance of probability be satisfied
that,  the  property  in  respect  of  which  the  action  has  been
instituted is proceeds of crime.

(8)  Non- conviction based forfeiture proceedings may be
instituted  even  where  criminal  proceedings  had  been
instituted against the person accused of having committed
the  corresponding  unlawful  activity  and  he  had  been
acquitted or discharged at the trial or appellate stage.

(9) If the proceeds of an unlawful activity which comes
within the jurisdiction of this Act is found outside Sri Lanka,
non–conviction  based  forfeiture  proceedings  in  respect  of
such property may be instituted in the High Court, without
any initial steps of restrain, seizure or judicial freezing having
taken place in terms of this Act.

(10)  Where  a  person  who  has  committed  an  unlawful
activity either within or outside Sri Lanka, is convicted by a
court of competent jurisdiction of another country and the
proceeds  of  such  unlawful  activity  is  found  in  Sri  Lanka,
non-conviction  based  forfeiture  proceedings  in  respect  of
such property may be instituted and carried out, without the
initial steps of the restraint, seizure or judicial freezing of
such property taking place in terms of this Act.

(11)

In view of the need to ensure that action in terms of
this  Act  does  not  cause  a  serious  impact  on  the  national
economy or public interest, it shall be lawful for the Attorney-
General  to  institute  non-conviction  based  forfeiture
proceedings in the High Court notwithstanding the property
in  respect  of  which  proceedings  are  being  instituted  have
not  been  subjected  to  any  prior  restraining,  preservation,
seizure or judicial freezing:

Provided however, following the filing of the application
for  the  commencement  of  proceedings  for  non-conviction
based forfeiture of suspected proceeds of crime, the Attorney-
General  shall  satisfy  the  High  Court  that  prima-facie  the
property  in  respect  of  which  action  has  been  instituted  is
proceeds of crime.

(13) In an Inquiry conducted under section, oral evidence
shall  be  led,  only  if  under  exceptional  circumstances  the
Court grants permission in that regard on the basis that such
oral evidence is necessary for the determination of the matter.

(14)  In  proceedings  under  this  section,  the  High  Court
may apply the presumption contained in section 34 for the
purpose of determining whether the property in respect of
which proceedings have been instituted is proceeds of crime,
and determining the legitimacy of a claim by any person for
the release of the property in respect of which proceedings
have been instituted.

(15) A party seeking to gain control or possession of the
property in respect of which action has been instituted, shall
establish a lawful claim on a balance of probability and to a

that the property in respect of which proceedings have been
instituted is a property of any particular victim of crime, the

the High Court shall make order forfeiting the property.

(18) If following inquiry, the High Court determines that
only a portion in respect of which proceedings have been
instituted  under  this  section  for  non-conviction  based
forfeiture of proceeds of crime, the Court shall following the
determination of the value of the relevant proceeds of crime
make Order that the property be forfeited to the state and the
state making a payment to the party entitled to the remaining
portion of the value.

(19)  If  the  High  Court  directs  that  a  claimant  has  on  a
balance  of  probability  presented  a  lawful  claim  for  such
property, the High Court shall make order directing that the
property in respect of which proceedings were instituted be
released to such claimant.

(20)  If  the  High  Court  determines  that  the  property  in
respect of which proceedings have been instituted belongs
to a claimant who is a victim of the corresponding crime, it
shall  make  order  releasing  the  property  to  such  victim  of
crime.

(21)  If  the  High  Court  determines  that  the  property  in

make order subject to the provisions contained in this Act,
releasing  the  property  or  part  thereof  or  its  value  to  the

contained in this Act, shall not be deemed as a punishment
or as any penalty imposed on any person, and by virtue of
such  forfeiture,  no  person  shall  be  subjected  to  any
disqualification or other sanction.

(25)  If  during  proceedings  under  section,  on  evidence
placed before Court and further evidence if any called for
and examined by court, the court becomes satisfied that the
property in respect of which forfeiture proceedings has been
instituted comprises partly of proceeds of crime and partly
of property which does not constitute proceeds of crime, the
court shall obtain a valuation of such property and determine
the  percentage  value  of  such  property  which  constitutes
proceeds of crime.

in the manner provided by this Act and upon realization of
the value thereof direct the Registrar of the court to make

to court that in view of the present condition or attendant
circumstances relating to the property, the disposal of such
property  may  not  be  possible  or  may  not  give  rise  to  the
realization of true value of such property, and the Court is
satisfied of such reason, the court may make necessary orders
to relevant Competent Authorities of the Government with
regard  to  the  property,  so  as  to  enable  the  disposal  of  the
property through public auction and realization of true value
thereof.

Authority of the Government of Sri Lanka.

(4) The PCMA, Receiver or Special Manager as the case
may  be  shall  on  the  direction  of  the  court  dispose  of  the
property and upon realization of the value thereof credit the
said sum of money to the account titled  “Proceeds of Disposal
of Proceed of Crime” of the PCMA.

(5) Following the receipt of the money realized from the
disposal of the forfeited property, the PCMA shall disburse
the said funds in the manner provided for in this Act.

(5) If at the time the Court is required to make an order for
the  disbursement  of  monies  arising  out  of  the  disposal  of
forfeited  proceeds  of  crime,  the  PCMA  has  not  been
established  or  is  in  capable  of  performing  its  functions  in

(2)  A  plaintiff  claiming  damages  and  compensation
founded upon the cause of action referred to in the subsection
(1) shall institute civil action in the relevant district court
and  shall  be  required  to  establish  his  case  by  proving  the
ingredients  of  the  offence  which  constitute  the  relevant
unlawful activity on a balance of probabilities.

(3)  For  the  purpose  of  successfully  prosecuting  a  civil
action founded upon the cause of action referred to above, it
shall  not  be  necessary  for  the  plaintiff  to  establish  that
defendant has been convicted of having committed unlawful
activity or that the proceeds of the unlawful activity have
been traced, identified or recovered.

(4) The entitlement to institute civil proceedings founded
upon  the  cause  of  action  referred  to  above  shall  be
independent  of  any  criminal  investigation,  criminal
prosecution or the outcome thereof.

Illustration:

(a) X who is the accountant of a company commits
criminal breach of trust and with the proceeds of
such unlawful activity purchases a motor vehicle.
The  Company  complaints  to  the  Police.  The
Police may or may not commence taking action
against X in terms of this Act and other provisions
of  the  law.  Independent  of  the  action  taken  or
otherwise by the Police and or the institution of
criminal proceedings against X, the company shall
be  entitled  to  institute  civil  action  against  X
invoking the afore-stated cause of action for the
purpose of recovering pecuniary loss suffered by
it as a result of the committing of the afore-stated
unlawful  activity.

(b) X commits the offence of corruption with regard
to funds allocated for a particular public purpose.
This results in reduction of funds available for the
afore-stated public purpose by a specific amount
or  percentage.  Consequentially  the  reduction  in
the  benefit  to  the  community  for  whose  benefit
the  public  purpose  was  to  be  given  effect  to  is
calculated  either  in  monetary  terms  or  in  a
quantified  reduction  of  the  scheduled  public
purpose. Thus, those who have suffered pecuniary
or sentimental loss, deprivation of the envisaged
service,  facility,  or  benefit  as  a  result  of  the
unlawful activity carried out by X, shall be entitled
to sue X either jointly or severally for the purpose
of  obtaining  damages  or  compensation  to
commensurate the loss or damage suffered.

(c) X commits an act of corruption which does not
result  in  personal  financial  gain  to  him.
Notwithstanding X not having personally gained
from  the  committing  of  such  unlawful  activity,
any  party  adversely  affected  by  such  unlawful
activity  shall  be  entitled  to  sue  X,  to  recover
pecuniary or sentimental loss directly or indirectly
suffered  by  them  as  a  result  of  the  afore-stated
unlawful  activity.

(6)  Where  more  than  one  person  has  suffered  loss  or
damages due to an unlawful activity committed by another
person as referred to in subsection (1) -

institute proceedings in terms of this Part for the purpose of
recovering  damages  or  compensation  in  respect  of  loss
suffered by such parties as a result of the committing of the
unlawful  activity.

(7) Unless the evidence of a person who is knowledgeable
and  specially  skilled  with  regard  to  pecuniary  and
sentimental loss suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the
committing of the unlawful activity is presented to court by
the plaintiff, the court may at its discretion call one or more
such  persons  who  is  knowledgeable  and  specially  skilled
for the purpose of assisting court regarding the determination
of loss or damages suffered by the plaintiff or parties being
represented by such plaintiff.

(8)  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  the
Prescription Ordinance (Chapter 68), an action in terms of
this Part shall be instituted within three years from the date
on which the plaintiff became aware of the committing of an
unlawful activity which resulted in loss or damage suffered
by such plaintiff.
