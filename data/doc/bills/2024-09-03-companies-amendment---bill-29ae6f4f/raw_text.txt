exercises  effective  control
through  other  means,  and
beneficial  ownership  is  to  be
construed  accordingly;

“effective control” includes a situation
where  control  is  exercised
indirectly either through a chain
of ownership or by appointment
or removal of a director or by any
other  means  of  indirect  control,

decision that affects the operation
of  the  company,  its  business
