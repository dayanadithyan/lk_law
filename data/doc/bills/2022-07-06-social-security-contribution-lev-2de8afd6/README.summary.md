- The bill was presented by the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies on July 6, 2022.
- The legislation applies to various individuals who are importers, manufactures, service providers or wholesale/retail sellers.
- The levy will be imposed at a rate of 2.5% from every taxable person for every quarter commencing on July 1, 2022.
- The act allows for reports, appeals, and adjustments in relation to the levy.
- In case of default in payment, a penalty will be levied at 10% of the defaulter's amount, and a further 2% for each month the defaulter fails to pay, with penalties not exceeding a 100% of the levy in default.
