- **Act Enacted**: Recovery of Possession of Premises Given on Lease Act, No. 1 of 2023, certified on January 17, 2023.
- **Purpose**: To regulate the recovery process of leased premises, arrears of lease rentals, service charges, and liquidated damages.
- **Action by Lessor**: Lessors can institute legal actions to recover premises in court where premises are located, lessee resides, the cause of action arose, or where the lease agreement was executed.
- **Grounds for Action**: Recovery can be initiated if the lessee fails to vacate at the lease expiration or breaches lease terms resulting in early termination.
- **Required Documents**: Lessor must file a plaint, an affidavit, a draft decree nisi, and copies of pertinent documents.
- **Decree Nisi**: Court issues a decree nisi if lease agreement and affidavit satisfy legal requirements and shows prima facie case. Service of decree nisi is usually by registered post.
- **Defendant's Response**: Defendants must seek leave to appear and show cause against the decree nisi, supported by a petition and affidavit.
- **Security**: If leave is granted, the defendant must deposit security covering arrears, service charges, and liquidated damages.
- **Service Failure**: If defendants fail to apply for leave, furnish security, or disclose a sustainable defense, the decree nisi is made absolute without further notice.
- **Appeals**: Appeals against a decree nisi made absolute are limited; appeals aren't allowed for failure to apply for leave but can petition for setting aside decree on grounds like accident, misfortune, or improper service.
- **Execution**: Once decree nisi is absolute, it is deemed a writ of execution. Fiscal must execute it without further notice. Resistance to execution is treated as contempt of court.
- **Compensation**: Court may award compensation to defendants if decree is obtained through suppression or non-disclosure of material facts.
- **Settlement**: Defendants can agree to terms for surrendering possession or settling dues, resulting in an absolute decree that stays execution proceedings unless breached.
- **No Bar for Subsequent Actions**: Discharge of decree nisi or action dismissal doesnâ€™t bar other actions for premises recovery by entitled persons.
