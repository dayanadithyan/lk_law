# Types of Legal Documents 

The documents in this repo have been sourced from the Website of the [Department of Government Printing](http://documents.gov.lk), which publishes various Legal Documents, including [Gazette](http://documents.gov.lk./en/gazette.php), [Extraordinary Gazettes](http://documents.gov.lk./en/exgazette.php), [Bills](http://documents.gov.lk./en/bills.php) and [Acts](http://documents.gov.lk./en/acts.php). 

## üìÑ Bill 

A Bill is **a proposal** for a new law, or a proposal to amend an existing law, that is presented for debate and approval.

Bills can be **introduced by various members** or groups within a legislative body, like members of parliament or congress, depending on the country's specific system.

A Bill goes through several **stages of scrutiny** and debate, where it may be discussed, amended, or rejected.

Bills are **not law**; they are merely proposals that legislatures consider turning into law.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Act  

An Act, also known as a statute, is **a law that has been enacted**.

A **Bill becomes an Act** when it has been approved in its final form by the legislature and has received the necessary formal approvals (such as the signature of the head of state or a governor, depending on the jurisdiction).

Once it becomes an Act, it has **legal force** and can be enforced.

An Act is a **finalized document** that represents the law as it stands, after all debates and amendments have been concluded.

## üì∞ Gazette

A "Gazette" is an official publication used by governments to communicate important information to the public. It serves as a public journal and is used for formal and legal purposes. The contents and functions of a gazette can vary by country, but generally, it includes the following:

1. Legal Notices: It contains legal notices, including new laws, regulations, and statutory instruments. When a law is passed, it is often published in the gazette to become official and enforceable.

2. Government Announcements: It's used for official government announcements, such as appointments to public offices, government decisions, and administrative instructions.

3. Public Notices: Gazettes may also include notices that are of interest to the public, such as bankruptcy notices, company liquidation details, and changes in business registrations.

4. Tenders and Contracts: Governments often use gazettes to announce tenders, procurement details, and contract awards.

### üö® Gazette Extraordinary

A "Gazette Extraordinary" refers to a special edition of the official government gazette that is published to announce urgent or very important information. Unlike regular editions of the gazette, which may have a fixed publication schedule (like daily, weekly, or monthly), a Gazette Extraordinary is issued specifically to disseminate information that is too urgent or significant to wait for the next regular issue
